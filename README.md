# LieGroupsPython
Modules containing Lie group operators written in Python. These have been created with the only purpose of being applied in variational integration. Currently SO(3) and SE(3) are available.

These were created to work in tandem with [autograd](https://github.com/HIPS/autograd). If you do not wish to use autograd, simply change the initial imports to

```python
import numpy as np
```
